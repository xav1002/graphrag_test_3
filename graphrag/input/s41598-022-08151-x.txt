Halophiles are a class of microorganisms that thrive in environments with very high salt 
concentrations. The coastal regions of Saurashtra Gujarat host a diverse group of microorganisms 
including halophilic and halotolerant bacteria that may have plant growth promoting characteristics. 
Microorganisms with plant growth promoting characteristics are of immense importance in the 
field of agriculture and the present study was conducted to investigate the characteristics of 
halophilic and halotolerant bacteria isolated from agricultural soils of coastal regions of Junagadh 
and Porbandar districts of Saurashtra, Gujarat. A total of 15 isolated strains showed indole acetic 
acid production, solubilization of phosphate and potash, and nitrogen fixing capacity ranging from 
18.77–33.48 μg  ml−1, 50.10–106.10%, 180.42–239.92% and 0.170–0.480 g  kg−1 of Jensen’s agar 
medium, respectively, while two isolates were also found positive for siderophore production. 
Besides, nine out of fifteen isolates also showed positive ACC deaminase activity ranging from 
0.92-5.78 µM α-ketobutyrate  mg−1  h−1. The isolates were further characterized by physiological, 
microscopic, and biochemical tests. The halophilic and halotolerant bacterial isolates were identified 
by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as belonging to Halomonas pacifica, H. stenophila, and Bacillus 
haynesii, B. licheniformis  and Oceanobacillus aidingensis  respectively. The 16S rRNA partial gene 
sequence of two isolates belonging to H. pacifica and H. stenophila were submitted to NCBI with 
accession number MK955347 and MK961217 respectively. The findings of the present investigation 
showed that isolated bacterial halophiles possess promising plant growth promoting characteristics. 
Their potential as bioinoculants to alleviate salinity stress in crops and for bioremediation deserves 
further investigation.
Halophiles are organisms that thrive in high salt environments by balancing the osmotic pressure of the environ-
ment in order to resist the denaturing effects of salts. Most halophiles have been placed in the Archaea domain, 
but there are also halophiles belonging to Bacteria and Eukarya domains, for instance alga Dunaliella salina  or 
fungus Wallemia ichthyophaga . Thus, halophiles include all the three domains of life, viz., Archaea, Bacteria, 
and Eukarya and contain representatives of many different physiological types adapted to a wide range of salt 
 concentrations1.
Halophiles have been classified by many scientists using different standards. The classification proposed by 
Kushner and  Kamekura2 that groups halophiles according to their ability to survive at varying NaCl concentra-
tions is reported to be the most widely accepted by most scientists. Based on this classification, halophilic micro-
organisms are divided into different categories as follows: Extreme halophiles, able to grow optimally in media 
with 15–30% w/v (2.5–5.2 M) NaCl. Borderline extreme halophiles, requiring at least 12% w/v NaCl. Moderate 
halophiles, growing optimally in media with 3–15% w/v (0.5–2.5 M) NaCl, and Slight halophiles, able to grow 
optimally at between 1 and 3% w/v (0.2–0.5 M) NaCl.OPEN

www.nature.com/scientificreports/In contrast, non-halophilic microorganisms refer to those organisms that show optimum growth in media 
containing NaCl concentration less than 1% (0.2 M). However, those bacteria capable of growing irrespective of 
presence or absence of salt and capable of tolerating relatively high NaCl concentrations have been categorized as 
halotolerant or extremely tolerant if tolerance level exceeds 15% (2.5 M) NaCl. Thus, accordingly there are several 
categories of halotolerant microbes: Non-tolerant, those which tolerate only a small concentration of salt (about 
1% w/v). Slightly tolerant, tolerating up to 6–8% (w/v). Moderately tolerant, up to 18–20% (w/v). Extremely 
tolerant, those microbes that grow over the whole range of salt concentrations from zero up to  saturation3.
A considerable number of halophilic and halotolerant bacteria have been reported to possess plant growth 
promoting characteristics. Ramadoss et al.4 showed that halotolerant bacteria isolated from saline habitats ame-
liorated the salt stress in wheat seedlings. Anbumalar et al.5 investigated the plant growth promoting potentialities 
of IAA and phosphate solubilizing halobacterium strains and showed their effectiveness in plant seed germina -
tion and growth in various crops like cotton, tomato, lady’s finger and maize under in vitro condition. Marakana 
et al.6 also reported that plant growth promoting halotolerant bacteria serve as a potential tool for alleviating 
salinity stress in salt sensitive crops.
Saurashtra, also known as Sorath or Kathiawar, is a peninsular region of Gujarat, with natural saline habitat 
in western India, located on the Arabian Sea. The coastal areas of the region covering the entire sampling sites 
of the present investigation represent one of the natural saline microbial biodiversity hotspots in the country 
harboring a diverse group of microorganisms including halophilic and halotolerant bacteria that may have plant 
growth promoting characteristics. Previous reports on successful isolation and characterization of rhizospheric 
halotolerant bacteria from Bhavnagar district of Saurashtra also showed plant growth promoting potential as 
reported by Gontia et al .7 and Jha et al .8,9.
Symbiotic or non-symbiotic soil microorganisms that colonize the rhizosphere, inhabit plant roots and exert 
a positive effect to plants directly or indirectly. The use of microorganisms with the aim of improving nutrients 
availability for plants is an important practice and necessary for agriculture irrespective of their source of habi -
tations throughout the world. Direct promotion of growth by PGPR occurs when the rhizobacteria produce 
metabolites that promote plant growth such as auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, ACC deaminase as well as 
through the solubilization of phosphate, potash, zinc minerals, nitrogen fixation etc. Indirect growth promotion 
occurs through the elimination of pathogens by the production of cyanide and siderophores. PGPR beneficial 
effects have been exploited in many areas including biofertilizers, microbial rhizoremediation and  biopesticides5.
The present study evaluated plant growth promoting characteristics of halophilic and halotolerant bacteria 
isolated from agricultural soils of coastal regions of Saurashtra, Gujarat.

www.nature.com/scientificreports/cular in shape with a majority being small to medium in size with flat to raised and convex type of elevations, 
while some of them were pigment producing. Colony pigmentation among isolates included pale yellow, creamy, 
shiny, watery and pure white. Most of the colonies had entire to irregular margins, while a few had undulate mar -
gins. The isolates also displayed different cell sizes and morphologies when viewed under the microscope. The 
cells ranged from coccus to short or thin long rod shape in single or pairs to bunchy type organization, while few 
were also found to be filamentous in structure. Nine isolates were gram negative while the remaining six were 
gram positive. All isolates were motile and some were spore forming in nature.
Determination of salt, pH and temperature tolerance test.  The results of tolerance to different 
NaCl, pH and temperatures by isolates are presented in Table  3. The isolates were capable of tolerating salt con-
centrations up to 25% with optimum growth between 10–15% NaCl, optimum pH ranged between 6–8 with 
tolerance towards extreme acidity and increased growth towards alkalinity, and temperature tolerance up to 
45 °C with optimum temperature observed at 35 °C.
Biochemical characterization. The results pertaining to various biochemical tests conducted are shown 
in Table  4. The biochemical tests were carried out in order to determine the different biochemical characteristics 
of the isolates as addressed in the discussion section.
IAA production. The results of indole acetic acid (IAA) production by isolates are shown in Table  5. The 
amount of IAA production by isolates ranged from 18.77 to 33.48 μg   ml−1 (Fig.  1) shown by isolates  S2 and  S1 
respectively.
Nitrogen fixation capacity. The results of nitrogen fixing capacity of isolates are presented in Table  5 
which were found to range from 0.170 to 0.480 g   kg−1 of Jensen’s agar medium shown by isolate  S11 and  S4 respec -
tively (Fig.  2). The statistical value of calculated F was greater than that of table F at both 1 and 5% respectively 
thus indicating a high level of significance at both 1 and 5%.
Qualitative phosphate solubilization test in solid medium. The results observed in qualitative 
phosphate solubilization capacity of isolates are presented in Table  6. Thirteen out of fifteen isolates showed 
positive test while two  (S5 and  S9) isolates were negative and did not show any zone of solubilization (ZOS) on 
the Sperber’s agar media. The highest ZOS and thereby solubilization efficiency was shown by isolate  S8 with ZOS Table 2.  Colony and microscopic characteristics of halophilic bacterial isolates.IsolatesColony characteristics Microscopic characteristics

www.nature.com/scientificreports/of 10.40 and 13.30 mm (Fig.  3), phosphate solubilization efficiency (PSE) of 183.60 and 111.10% on 3 and 5 DAI 
respectively and  S10 with ZOS of 16.30 mm (Fig.  4), PSE of 106.10% on 7 DAI. However, on 10 DAI there was 
very little or no increase in the ZOS in all isolates. Here, E. coli was kept as the negative control which showed no 
zone of clearance even after 10 days of inoculation on tricalcium phosphate (TCP) medium.
Quantitative phosphate solubilization test in liquid medium. The quantitative phosphate solubili-
zation capacity of isolates were estimated by measuring the drop in pH and release of Pi (inorganic phosphorous) 
in TCP broth recorded at intervals of 3, 5, 7 and 10 DAI (Table  7). The drop in broth pH of respective isolates 
were found to increase with incubation time for all the isolates and the maximum drop in pH (4.1 ± 0.09) was 
recorded in broth of isolate  S8 at 10 DAI followed by isolates  S11,  S4 and  S10 with drop in pH of (4.3 ± 0.09), 
(4.4 ± 0.09), (4.5 ± 0.09), respectively. The amount of Pi released from TCP also increased with incubation time Table 3.  Determination of NaCl, pH and temperature tolerance test of isolates. ‘−’: No growth; ʻ+ʼ: Minimal

(708.60 ± 16.59 μg   ml−1) were recorded in isolate  S11 followed by isolates  S4, and  S8 etc. respectively. The uninocu-
lated control tube showed a drop in pH up to (6.5 ± 0.09) at 10 DAI with very little soluble Pi released. So, there 
was a negative correlation between pH drop and Pi release in TCP broth (Table  8). The statistical evaluation of 
C.V . per cent of Pi released (μg   ml−1) and drop in pH in TCP broth of respective isolates indicated a high level of

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Potash solubilization capacity. The results pertaining to potash solubilization capacity of isolates are 
presented in Table  9. Only eight out of fifteen isolates were found positive for potash solubilization capacity in 
the Aleksandrow’s media. The highest ZOS and thereby solubilization efficiency was shown by isolate  S4 with 
ZOS of 9.60, 12.70, 17.23 and 17.83 mm (Fig.  5), potash solubilization efficiency (KSE) of 202.97, 195.46, 241.13 
and 239.92% on 3, 5, 7 and 10 DAI respectively. The E. coli which was included as a negative control showed 
no zone of solubilization even at 10 DAI. The KSE (%) was seen to increase rapidly from 3 to 7 DAI and then 
continued to increase slowly from 7 to 10 DAI for majority of the isolates.
Siderophore production potentiality. The results of siderophore production potentiality of isolates 
showed that only two out of fifteen isolates viz.,  S2 and  S6 were positive for siderophore production (Fig.  6). The 
siderophore type produced by these two isolates were further confirmed by tetrazolium test as hydroxymate 
type (Fig.  7) which was inferred by the instant appearance of deep red colour on addition of tetrazolium salt and 
NaOH to the test samples.
The results of qualitative and quantitative ACC deaminase production by isolates are shown in Table  10. Nine 
out of fifteen isolates were found positive for ACC deaminase activity while remaining six isolates showed nega-
tive activity. The amount of ACC deaminase production by isolates ranged from 0.92 to 5.78 μM α-ketobutyrate 
(α-KB)  mg−1  h−1 shown by isolates S9 and S15 respectively.Table 6.  Phosphate Solubilization Efficiency (PSE) of isolates on TCP media during 3, 5, 7 and 10 DAI. PSE

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis. The halophilic bacterial isolates studied were 
identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing on capillary sequencer (Applied Bio Systems 3130) using a pair of 16S 
universal primers. The PCR purified bands of isolates total genomic DNA extracts has been shown in (Fig.  8). 
The 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained were compared against the nucleotide sequences available in BLASTn 
Search in GenBank of NCBI. Comparative sequence analysis of BLASTn search on NCBI revealed that eight out 
of ten isolates designated as  S1,  S3,  S4,  S5,  S6,  S7,  S8 and  S11 belonging to genus Halomonas  were identified as H. 
pacifica  while two isolates designated as  S2 and  S9 were identified as H. stenophila. On the other hand, three out 
of four isolates designated as  S12,  S14 and  S15 belonging to genus Bacillus  were identified as B. haynesii  while one 
isolate designated as  S13 was identified as B. licheniformis  and the remaining one isolate designated as  S10 belong -
ing to genus Oceanobacillus  was identified as O. aidingensis. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequence of two isolates 
 S1 and  S2 were re-designated as Halomonas pacifica  strain HPSB1 and Halomonas stenophila  strain HPSB2 and 
submitted to NCBI with accession numbers MK955347 and MK961217 respectively. The Phylogenetic analysis 
of these two strains using NCBI BLAST pairwise alignments revealed their relatedness with other strains of 
respective species (Fig. 9) and similarly for remaining isolates (Supplementary Fig. S1 to S13).Table 7.  pH drop and Pi released from TCP broth by isolates on 3, 5, 7 and 10 DAI. Pi  inorganic phosphorous.

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Discussion
Preliminary analysis showed that the soils from which the halophilic bacteria were isolated were slight to moder -
ately alkaline, non-saline and low to medium with respect to availability of soil organic carbon, phosphorous and 
potash. These results agrees with the findings of Echigo et al.10 who reported that isolation of extreme halophiles 
can also occur from environments in which they are not expected to be actively growing.
The morphological characteristics of isolates deduced from the observed colony characteristics recorded in 
terms of size, shape, elevation, margin, texture, opacity, pigment and microscopic features showed the typical 
halophilic like colonies on media after 24 h of inoculation. These findings are similar to those by  Kambura11 
and Roohi et al .12.
The results of salt, pH and temperature tolerance showed that the isolates were moderate to extreme halophiles 
and moderate halotolerants, slightly acidophilic to alkaliphilic and mesophilic in nature with respect to their 
optimum growth and tolerance capacity at different levels of salt concentration, pH, and temperature.
Results from various biochemical tests conducted on isolates indicated that they were all capable of producing 
alpha-amylase, lipase and gelatinase enzymes, while five isolates were positive for indole production. A positive 
methyl red test for all isolates indicated that they are glucose fermenters. Hence, all the isolates showed negative 
Voges–Proskauer test as bacteria can give only either of the test positive except for some gram negative bacteria 
in exceptional conditions that are reported to give positive test for both methyl red and Voges–Proskauer test. 
On the other hand only one isolate tested positive for hydrogen sulfide production implying that only one of the 
fifteen isolates has an ability to reduce sulfur containing compounds to hydrogen sulfide during metabolism. All 
fifteen isolates tested positive for oxidase test whereas only twelve and five out of fifteen isolates were found posi-
tive for catalase and urease tests respectively. Ten out of fifteen isolates were found positive for nitrate reduction 
test. Only one out of fifteen isolates was detected positive for phenylalanine deamination test. All isolates were 
found capable of using glucose as their carbon source for energy. The same goes for arabinose except one isolate 
which tested negative for utilizing it as carbon source. Eleven, eight, seven, four, and two isolates tested positive 
in utilizing lactose, lysine, sorbitol, ornithine and citrate as carbon source respectively. However, no isolates were 
found positive to utilize adonitol as carbon source for their energy.
The amount of IAA produced by the isolates were found to be slightly more than the range 1 to 23 μg   ml−1 
reported by Verma et al.13 and Khamna et al.14. The results of mean comparison related to different isolates 
indicated that concentrations of IAA produced by the isolates under study are in agreement with the results of 
former studies reported by Padder et al .15 and Nghia et al.16. In their reports, the minimum to maximum IAA 
production at varying concentration of tryptophan in the medium ranged from 16.21 to 32.41 μg   ml−1 and 10.44 
to 33.13 μg   ml−1 respectively. However, the IAA production range of the isolates under study are much lower as 
compared to the range 78 to 101 μg   ml−1 reported by Nabti et al .17.Table 9.  Potash Solubilization Efficiency (KSE) of isolates on Aleksandrow’s media during 3, 5, 7 and 10 DAI.

www.nature.com/scientificreports/The positive nitrogen fixation capacity of the isolates quantified by micro Kjeldahl method even though 
in small quantity indicated the ability of the isolates to fix soil atmospheric nitrogen. Kanimozhi and 
 Panneerselvam18 also used the similar method and quantified the total amount of nitrogen fixed by Azospirillum  
isolates in nitrogen-free medium ranging from 3.3 to 15.6 mg N   g−1. Nitrogen fixation by free living organisms is 
a process that needs considerable amounts of organic matter to be effective. The free living organisms are said to 
be able to fix between 12 and 30 g N   kg−1 of carbon  source19. Thus the results of nitrogen fixation obtained from 
the isolates can be considered negligible to very low as compared to those of free living biological nitrogen fixers.
The solubilization of phosphates were confirmed from the formation of clear zones which is concerned with 
the P-solubilization by the isolates. These results implied that P-solubilization may be due to secretion of some 
substances into surroundings during the course of growing, which can solubilize phosphate or organophosphate. 
Phosphorous solubilization results are reported to vary depending on kinds of the metabolin, how quickly it

zone can only be used for qualitative  assays20. In the present study, the expansion of diameter of ZOS of the 
isolates during the interval of 5 to 10 DAI were found to be much lower than the range of 25 to 30 mm reported 
by Zhu et al .20.
The halophilic and halotolerant bacteria studied in the present investigation lowered the pH of the TCP broth. 
The maximum drop in pH in TCP broth recorded in isolates were in accordance with those found in halophilic 
bacterium strain Kushneria sp. YCW A18 by Zhu et al.20. However, the maximum release of soluble Pi from TCP 
broth in culture supernatant accompanied by the significant drop in pH i.e., acidification of TCP broth by isolates 
were significantly higher than that reported in the latter. This indicated the implication of organic acid produc -
tion in isolates. The negative correlation between drop in pH and Pi release, on the other hand, corroborates a

Several mechanisms like the process of acidification, chelation and exchange reaction or the production of low 
molecular weight organic acids have been implicated to render insoluble phosphates into soluble  form24.

solubilization efficiency (KSE) of the isolates were found to be lower by half than that reported in potash solubi-
lizing bacteria by Sun et al.25. However, they were within the range of 169–423% reported in the latter. Similarly, 
the maximum potassium solubilization index (KSI) of isolates were also slightly lower but in compliance with 
the range of 2.37–5.25 accounted in potash solubilizing bacteria by Fatharani and  Rahayu26. The measure of ZOS 
range of isolates studied were also within the range of 20.7–28.1 mm recorded on 7 DAI in potash solubilizing 
bacteria by Saha et al.27. The potash solubilization capacity of isolates indicated their potential to solubilize potash 
in agricultural soils thus making them available to the plants. This solubilization could be attributed to excre-
tion of organic acids which either directly dissolves rock K or chelate silicon ions to bring K into  solution28–31. 
Therefore, the application of K solubilizing halophilic bacteria could be of promising approach for increasing K 
availability in soils cultivated for high-K-demanding  crops32–34.
Siderophores are said to be produced especially in an environment where the iron is deficient thus causing 
the bacteria to excrete siderophore in the extracellular environment to sequester and solubilize iron. The inability 
of the isolates under study to produce siderophores can thus be attributed to the possible sufficiency of iron in 
their habitual environments. An investigation about connection between iron homeostasis and the osmostress 
response in the halophiles also reported a decrease in the requirement for both iron and histidine and a lower 
level of siderophore synthesis at high  salinity5. This report also correlates with the nature of isolates in the present 
study being high salt requiring and hence very low to no siderophore production in such high salinity.
The amount of ACC deaminase enzyme produced by the isolates were found to be three to six folds higher 
than the range 325–997 nmol   mg−1 protein  h−1 reported in halophilic and halotolerant bacterial strains by 
Mukhtar et al .35 but two folds lower than 11,172.1 nM   mg−1 protein  h−1 reported in halotolerant bacterial isolates 
by Tiwari et al .36. However, the ACC deaminase production of the isolates under study are in compliance with 
the range 0.69–4.90 μmol α-ketobutyrate  mg−1 protein  h−1 reported in halotolerant bacterial strains by Siddikee 
et al.37. Penrose and  Glick38 described that different organisms with a wide range of ACC deaminase activity can 
act as PGPR. A low level of ACC deaminase activity, approximately ≥ 20 nmol α-ketobutyrate  mg−1  h−1 is sufficient 
to permit a bacterium to grow on ACC and to act as a PGPR. Organisms with higher levels of ACC deaminase 
activity that is from 300 to 400 nmol α-ketobutyrate  mg−1  h−1 do not necessarily promote root elongation to 
any greater extent than the strains that contain less enzyme  activity38. The positive ACC deaminase activity of 
the isolates thus implies their ability to irreversibly cleave ACC molecules (intermediate precursor formed by 
the conversion of S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAM) (itself converted from main ‘precursor of ethylene’ called 
methionine by SAM synthase) by ACC-synthase which is further converted by ACC-oxidase into  ethylene39) 
into α-ketobutyrate and  ammonia40, and may thereby promote plant growth by alleviating stress by lowering 
ethylene  levels41 under various stress conditions.
Methods
The study was carried out at “Department of Biotechnology, College of Agriculture, Junagadh Agricultural 
University, Junagadh” during the academic year 2018–2019. A total of fifteen isolates was used for studying the 
various plant growth promoting activities with three replication each for each experiment using a completely 
randomized design (CRD).
Soil sample collection. The soil samples were collected from coastal regions of Saurashtra, Gujarat viz., 
Junagadh and Porbandar districts located at coordinates 21.52°N 70.47°E and 21°37′48″ N 69°36′0″ E respec-
tively. The names of the sites within the respective districts from which the soil samples were collected with due 
consultation and permissions have been shown in Table  11. A total of 15 soil samples (approximately 100 g each) 
were collected from agricultural fields from a depth of 5 cm around the crop rhizospheres with the help of an 
agricultural soil sampler.
Preliminary soil analysis. The preliminary analysis of soil samples were carried out to determine the soil 
chemical properties viz., soil pH by potentiometry and electrical conductivity by conductometry  method42, and 
soil organic carbon content by back titration  method43, available soil phosphorous by colorimetric  method44 and 
potash by flame photometry  method42.
Isolation of halophilic bacteria from soil samples. Halophilic bacteria were isolated from 15 differ -
ent soil samples and inoculated by streak plate method on freshly prepared halophilic agar plates containing 
in grams per litre: 10 g casein acid hydrolysate, 10 g yeast extract, 5 g proteose peptone, 3 g tri-sodium citrate, 
2 g potassium chloride, 25 g magnesium sulphate and 20 g agar supplemented with 10% NaCl adjusted to pH 
7.2 ± 0.2 (at 25 °C) and incubated at 35 °C for 5 days.
Morphological characterization. Morphological characterization of all isolates were studied by plating 
on halophilic agar plates and incubating at 35 ± 2 °C for 24 h in BOD incubator. The morphological and cultural 
characteristics such as size, shape, elevation, margin, texture, opacity and pigment with regard to colonial char -
acters were then observed and recorded from the growth on halophilic agar plates. In addition it also included 
microscopic characterization by Gram’s staining, motility and scanning electron microscopic observation.12

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Determination of salt, pH and temperature tolerance test. The salt, pH and temperature tolerance 
of all isolates were tested separately in halophilic broth tubes supplemented with NaCl concentrations rang-
ing from 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 per cent for salt tolerance, pH ranging from 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0, 8.0 and 10.0 for pH 
tolerance, and the temperature ranging from 18, 25, 35 and 45 °C for temperature tolerance. These tubes were 
inoculated with 0.1 ml (having  107 CFU   ml−1) previously grown culture of all isolates. A tube without inocula-
tion served as the negative control for each range of salt, pH and temperature respectively. The isolates were 
inoculated and incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for 8–10 days. The strain that could grow at particular range of salt, pH 
and temperature were considered as tolerant by observing the presence or absence of growth and comparing it 
with negative control respectively for each isolates.
Biochemical characterization. Biochemical characterization of isolates were carried out by using a 
HiPure Bacterial Identification Kit obtained from HiMedia for biochemical tests viz., glucose, adonitol, lactose, 
arabinose, sorbitol, citrate, lysine and ornithine utilization, urease detection, phenyl alanine deamination, nitrate 
reduction and  H2S production tests. Other biochemical tests viz., starch, lipid and gelatin hydrolysis, indole 
production, methyl red, Voges–Proskauer and catalase tests were carried out manually according to the standard 
protocol followed by Nezami et al.45 while oxidase test was based on the method described by  Nyakeri46.
IAA production. In vitro IAA production of isolates were determined following the protocol described by 
Khalid et al.47 on a freshly prepared 10 ml Glucose Phosphate Broth (GPB) medium prepared in 100 ml Erlen-
meyer flasks. l-Tryptophan was added at desired concentration to the liquid medium by filter sterilization and 
passing through 0.2 μm membrane filter. 1.0 ml of 3-days old isolates broth  (107 CFU   ml−1) were then inoculated 
into each flasks and incubated at 30 ± 2 °C for 48 h. A flask containing the same broth medium without inocula-
tion was kept as negative control for comparison. Following incubation, the isolates’ broth culture contents were 
filtered through Whattman filter paper No.2 and 3.0 ml of culture filtrate were taken in test tubes and 2.0 ml 
of Salkowski’s reagent was added for measuring IAA production. The test tubes containing the contents were 
then allowed to stand for 1/2 h for color development. The colour development were observed in both standard 
solutions and culture filtrate of IAA and the intensity of color developed were measured by spectrophotometer 
at 530 nm and recorded. The concentration of IAA produced by the bacterial isolates were then deduced by 
calculation from the IAA standard curve.
Nitrogen fixation capacity. The nitrogen fixing capacity of the selected halophilic bacterial isolates were 
studied on a nitrogen free Jensen’s agar medium. The plates were inoculated by streaking the isolate culture onto 
the plates and incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for 5 days. The nitrogen fixation capacity of the bacterial isolates were then 
determined by micro Kjeldahl digestion and distillation  method48. The uninoculated plate of the same media 
was used as negative control. The nitrogen content in the nitrogen free media which is equivalent to the amount 
of nitrogen fixed by the isolates were then determined by calculating with the following formula:
where, 0.05 = Normal concentration of  H2SO4 used; 0.014  = Conversion factor.
Qualitative phosphate solubilization test in solid medium.  Qualitative phosphate solubilization 
test in Sperber’s medium was carried out as per standard protocol followed by Nosrati et al.49. To examine Pi 
(Inorganic phosphorus) solubilization capabilities, 10 μl of the bacterial suspensions (~  104 CFU   ml−1) was spot-
ted with the help of sterile inoculating needle onto the center of Sperber medium plate containing insoluble Pi. 
The inoculated plates were incubated at 28 °C. A Sperber agar plate spotted with E. coli was kept as the negative 
control. The zone of solubilization was recorded at 3, 5, 7 and 10 days after inoculation. The Solubilization Index 
(SI) was determined by measuring the ratio of halo (clear zone) diameter (mm) and the colony diameter as per 
the formula followed by  Nautiyal50. And the Solubilization Efficiency (SE) was calculated by the formula fol-
lowed by Nguyen et al.51.Nitrogen content (%)=[(ml of 0.05 N sulphuric acid for sample −ml of 0.05 N sulphuric

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Quantitative phosphate solubilization test in liquid medium. Quantitative phosphate solubiliza-
tion test in liquid medium was carried out in phosphate solubilization medium as per standard protocol fol-
lowed by  Dahale52. Erlenmeyer flasks (250 ml) containing 50 ml of phosphate solubilization estimation medium 
(containing per litre: 0.5 g yeast extract, 10 g dextrose, 5 g  CaCl2, 0.5 g  (NH4)2SO4, 5 g  Ca3(PO4)2, 0.2 g KCl, 
0.1 g  MgSO4, 0.0001 g  MnSO4 and 0.0001 g  FeSO4, pH 7.0) were inoculated with 100 μl of bacterial suspension 
(approx.  107 CFU/ml) in triplicates and incubated on rotary shaker (180 rpm) at 28 °C. After an intervals of 3, 
5, 7 and 10 days, samples were drawn aseptically and centrifuged at 5000×g for 10 min to pellet the cell biomass 
and insoluble phosphate and the supernatants were used for the measurement of pH using pH meter for the 
determination of acidity and liberated Pi following phosphomolybdic blue color  method42. The amount of Pi 
released in respective broths were estimated from three flasks each after incubation (DAI) in comparison with 
a set of uninoculated control. The concentration of Pi released were then calculated by plotting a graph of OD 
versus concentration of phosphates released in μg for standard and samples followed by their comparisons.
Estimation of pH change in broth culture. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation of each isolate 
culture at 3, 5, 7 and 10 DAI were examined for change in pH for determining acidity using a digital pH meter. 
The drop in pH in supernatants of each respective culture broth were recorded by comparing with the initial pH 
kept at 7.0.
Estimation of Pi released from culture supernatant. The available phosphorous content in the broth 
supernatant of each respective isolates were estimated by following phosphomolybdic blue color  method42. A 
known varying concentration of potassium dihydrogen phosphate was used to prepare the standard curve. One 
ml supernatant of each isolates and control were then taken in 50 ml volumetric flask and 10 ml of chloromo-
lybdic acid was added to it and the contents were mixed thoroughly. The volume was adjusted to three fourth 
with distilled water and 0.25 ml chlorostannous acid was added followed by immediate adjustment of volume to 
50 ml with distilled water. After 15 min, the intensity of blue color developed were measured in UV spectropho-
tometer at 610 nm using reagent blank.
Potash solubilization capacity. The potash solubilization capacity of the selected halophilic bacterial 
isolates were tested qualitatively on an aleksandrow agar plates. A loopful of bacterial cells were picked from 
the respective fresh isolate culture broth and spotted in the middle of the plates containing solidified medium. 
The inoculated plates were then incubated in the incubator by placing them upside down at 30 °C for 4 days. An 
Aleksandrow agar plate spotted with an E. coli culture in the centre served as the negative control. The different 
bacterial isolates showing ability to solubilize potash by forming zone around their colony growth were consid-
ered as positive potash solubilizing bacteria. The diameter of zone of clearance or solubilization (halo) observed 
around the bacterial colony and the diameter of colony were measured after 3, 5, 7 and 10 days of inoculation in 
triplicates. Potash solubilization index (KSI) was then calculated as the ratio of diameter of halo (mm)/diameter 
of colony (mm) as per the formula followed by  Nautiyal50. And the Solubilization Efficiency (SE) was calculated 
by the formula followed by Nguyen et al.51.
Siderophore production potentiality. The siderophore production potentiality of isolates were deter -
mined by following qualitative plate assay on Chrome Azurol S blue agar medium (CAS) to detect the sidero-
phore production by isolates as per method described by  Bhatt53. The CAS agar media was prepared according 
to the step-by-step procedure described by Louden et al.54. The individual CAS plates were then spot inoculated 
by overnight grown cultures of respective isolates and incubated at 30 ± 2 °C for 24 h. The isolates showing yellow 
to orange colored ring around the colonies were then considered as positive siderophore producing strains. The 
siderophore types produced were further identified as hydroxymate, catechol or carboxylate type by Tetrazo-
lium, Arnow’s, and Carboxylate test respectively as per the standard protocol described by  Bhatt53.
Qualitative ACC deaminase production. Qualitative ACC deaminase production test was carried out 
using a simple plate assay following the standard  protocol38 in Dworkin and Foster (DF)55 minimal salts medium 
containing per litre of distilled water: 4.0 g  KH2PO4, 6.0 g  Na2HPO4, 0.2 g  MgSO4.7H2O, 2.0 g glucose, 2.0 g 
gluconic acid and 2.0 g citric acid with trace elements: 1 mg  FeSO4.7H2O, 10 μg  H3BO3, 11.19 μg  MnSO4.H2O, 
124.6 μg  ZnSO4.7H2O, 78.22 μg  CuSO4.5H2O, 10 μg  MoO3, adjusted to pH 7 and then supplemented with 1.8% 
(w/v) Bacto-Agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) which has a very low nitrogen content. After sterilizing 
the media by autoclaving at 15 psi 121 °C for 20 min, the heat-labile ACC was filter-sterilized through a 0.2-mm 
membrane at a concentration of 3 mM and the filtrate was added to the DF salts minimal medium as a sole nitro-
gen source and poured onto each plates marked as DF-ACC. After solidification, the plates were spot inoculated 
with fresh isolates inoculum and incubated for 72 h at 32 ± 2 °C but not higher than 35 °C to avoid inhibition of 
ACC deaminase activity of the isolates. Plates containing only DF minimal salts medium without ACC marked 
as DF plates were used as the negative control and those with  (NH4)2SO4 (0.2% w/v) in place of ACC marked as 
ACC-NH3 plates were used as the positive  control56. Isolates showing growth on ACC-supplemented plates were 
compared to the negative and positive controls and considered as positive for ACC deaminase production as 
indicated by their ability to break down ACC and utilize it as the nitrogen source for growth.SI=(Colony diameter +diameter of halo )/Colony diameter

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Quantitative ACC deaminase production. The ACC deaminase activity of isolates were estimated by 
performing quantitative test as described hereafter. The bacterial isolates were cultured first in rich medium and 
then transferred to minimal medium with ACC as the sole nitrogen source in order to create culture conditions 
that favors the induction of isolates ACC deaminase activity. The isolates exhibiting positive ACC deaminase 
activity in the qualitative test were cultured first in a 15 ml fresh TSB broth and incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for 24–48 h 
on a shaker incubator at 150–200 rpm. After incubation, the accumulated biomass of the respective isolate cul-
tures were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and supernatants were discarded. The cell 
pellet of each isolates were then washed with 5 ml of either 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.6) or fresh DF salts minimal 
medium and centrifuged again and pellets resuspended in 15 ml DF minimal salt medium containing ACC at a 
final concentration of 3 mM in triplicates and incubated at 32 °C for another 36–72 h on a shaker incubator. The 
bacterial cells were then harvested again by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants 
were discarded and the cell pellet of each isolates were washed twice with 5 ml of 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.6) to 
ensure the pellets were free of the bacterial growth  medium38 and re-suspended in 1 ml of 0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 
7.6) in new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. The contents of the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes were centrifuged at 
16,000×g for 5 min and the supernatants were removed and the pellets were re-suspended in 600 μl of 0.1 M 
Tris–HCl (pH 8.5). Thirty microliter of 5% toluene (v/v) were added to the respective cell suspensions and 
vortexed for 30 s to labilize the cells. Then, 200 μl of labilized cell suspensions were transferred to a clean 1.5 ml 
microcentrifuge tubes and 20 μl of 0.5 M ACC was added and briefly vortexed for 5 s and then incubated at 30 °C 
for 15 min. About 200 μl of labilized cell suspension without ACC was kept as negative control and 0.1 M Tris–
HCl (pH 8.5) with 20 μl of 0.5 M ACC was kept as blank. The samples were then mixed thoroughly with 1 ml 
of 0.56 N HCl by vortexing and the cell debris removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at room tem-
perature and 1 ml of supernatants were transferred to a glass test tube and mixed with 800 μl of 0.56 N HCl and 
300 μl of DNP solution i.e. 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent (0.2% 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 2 M HCl). 
The content mixture were then vortexed and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Then 2 ml of 2 N NaOH were added 
to the sample mixture prepared above and the absorbance were measured at 540 nm in  spectrophotometer57. 
Finally, the ACC deaminase activity of isolates were determined by measuring the amount of α-ketobutyrate 
formed by the cleavage of ACC by ACC deaminase in each samples by comparing their absorbance at 540 nm to 
a standard curve generated by α-ketobutyrate.
Molecular identification by 16S rRNA gene amplification. The DNA for 16S rRNA gene amplifica-
tion were isolated using Qiagen’s DNA extraction  DNeasy® Blood and Tissue kit (250) and the 16S rRNA gene 
amplification were carried out on capillary sequencer (Applied Bio Systems 3130) with the help of a pair of uni-
versal oligonucleotide primers viz., forward and reverse primers designated as 005F and 907R with sequences 
5′-TGG AGA  GTT  TGA  TCC TGG CTCAG-3′ and 5 ′-CCG TCA ATTCMTTT RAG TTT-3′ respectively. The partial 
16S rRNA gene sequence obtained from studied bacteria were analyzed and identified with nucleotide BLAST 
search in Gene Bank of NCBI.

Conclusions
From the present study it was concluded that the halophilic and halotolerant bacterial isolates from agricultural 
soils of coastal regions of Saurashtra, Gujarat exhibited a very good plant growth promoting characteristics and 
represent a potent source of biofertilizers as plant growth promoting halobacteria and may help contribute to 
sustainable agriculture in such adverse conditions through reclamation and recovery of saline soils by support -
ing crop growth and metabolisms. However, the reported activities of the isolated halotolerant and halophilic 
bacteria represent only a potential for plant growth promotion. Further inoculation with the candidate PGP-
bacteria and salt stressed plants in salt affected soil are necessary for a more complete assessment of plant growth 
promotion abilities.
