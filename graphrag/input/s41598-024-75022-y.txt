growth-promoting properties
Naveena Radhakrishnan & Chitra Krishnasamy
PGPR has a higher potential impact on agricultural crops. It enhances plant growth and development 
in a variety of adverse environmental conditions, including biotic and abiotic stresses. The PGPR is 
commercially vital since it is more efficient, safe for the environment, and beneficial to the economy . 
Nowadays, salt stress has an impact on the agricultural ecosystem. Salt-tolerant PGPR can directly 
stimulate plant growth and development by producing a variety of metabolites and phytohormones. 
The current study looked at the isolation of salt-tolerant bacterial species and their ability to stimulate 
plant development. Four bacterial species were chosen for their better salt stress tolerance (0–5%). 
They were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing: Solibacillus silvestris  BR1, Peribacillus frigoritolerans  
BR2, Paenibacillus taichungensis  CR1, and Solibacillus isronensis  CR2. These strains were positive 
production of indole acetic acid with varying incubation periods (19.66 ± 1.528 to 646.111 ± 8.058 µg/
mL), salt stress (ranging from 29.556 ± 1.171 to 147.8111 ± 2.086 µg/mL), phosphate solubilization 
(0.145 ± 0.011 to 0.921 ± 0.007 µg/mL), ammonium production (0.299 ± 0.047 to 1.202 ± 0.142 µg/mL), 
HCN production (0.308 ± 0.051 to 4.269 ± 0.069 µg/mL), and siderophore production (0.190 ± 0.064 
to 1.543 ± 0.108 µg/mL) for control strains were used without salt stress. The production level was 
expressed using a standard curve containing various standards.

One of the most serious problems in agricultural soils is environmental stress, which includes both biotic 
and abiotic variables. Salinity stresses have negative consequences for the growth and production of many 
agricultural crops1. Soil salinization is a critical issue that significantly affects the structure, processes, and 
functions of global ecosystems2. In general, soil salinization is classified into two categories based on natural and 
human-induced actions: primary salinization and secondary salinization. Soil primary salinization is primarily 
influenced by the local climate, parent material, soil parameters, and groundwater. Insufficient rainfall, causing 
higher evapotranspiration and rising groundwater levels, can also lead to increased soil salinity3. Secondary or 
human-induced salinization occurs when humans use soil inappropriately. Saline irrigation, paired with poor 
drainage, may readily cause salt accumulation on the soil surface. In future climate change scenarios, seawater 
intrusion in coastal areas are expected to increases due to rising temperatures and fast development4. Soil 
salinization is one of the most adverse factors affecting plant development and causing land degradation and, 
as a result, diminishing potential net primary productivity and increasing desertification5. Increased soil salt 
content has a negative impact on both physical and chemical qualities, as well as microbiological processes. 
Electrical conductivity (EC) measures saline soil, which accumulates Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl−, HCO3−, SO42−, 
and vitamin B ions and negatively impacts plant growth6.  The excessive accumulation of these ions induces 
osmotic stress and toxicity by increasing Na+ assimilation and reducing the Na+/K+ ratio7. These issues can 
be attributed to lower osmotic potential within plant roots, which affects almost all aspects of plant growth, 
including germination, vegetative growth, and reproduction. Salinity alters various morphological, biochemical, 
and molecular characteristics. Toxic ions frequently cause reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in plant 
tissues. The produced ROS caused protein denaturation, DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and carbohydrate 
oxidation, which impaired enzyme performance and pigment degradation in plants8.
The highest concentrations of salt (Na+ and Cl-ions) cause a variety of agricultural problems, including 
porosity, aeration, and water conductivity9. In plants, they restrict plant metabolism and, to some extent,

www.nature.com/scientificreportsdisrupt photosynthesis by creating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause DNA damage, protein 
breakdown, and membrane injury. Salinity stress will also harm the physicochemical aspects of soil respiration 
as well as enzymatic and microbiological activity. Salt stress has been identified as the most harmful condition 
for agricultural soil10. Salinity has the greatest impact on the environment in terms of ecological change and 
soil variance in the future. This presents a challenge to agricultural crop productivity. Eco-friendly and non-
hazardous alternative technology is required to overcome negative impacts of salt stress on crops. Furthermore, 
plant growth-promoting microbes can be used to implement novel tactics. Soil contains a broad range of 
microbiomes. Rhizospheric soil microorganisms are made up of various types of clustered bacteria. Their 
symbiotic interaction with plants helps to minimize salinity stress11.
Applications of PGPR can be an effective elicitor to stimulate the inclusion of abiotic and biotic systematic 
tolerance in plants12. Rhizobacteria that promote plant growth are usually found in the plant’s root zone. This 
establishes a special symbiotic connection with plants. It will employ a direct mechanism to induce plant growth 
and development. The mechanisms involved are nutrient acquisition, HCN production, ammonium production, 
siderophore sequestration, and nitrogen fixation, synthesis of exo-polysaccharides and phytohormones, 
potassium and phosphate solubilization under salinity stress13, and upregulation of plant antioxidant defense 
enzymes to protect the plant from oxidative damage14. PGPR improves crop productivity and the production 
of plant growth regulators like auxin, gibberellins, cytokinin, ethylene, HCN, and antibiotics15. Many methods 
for PGPR-mediated salt stress resistance in plants have been documented in the literature. They specifically 
decrease the negative effects of high ethylene levels on plants, such as chlorosis, abscission, and senescence16. 
Furthermore, under salinity stress, NaCl causes rapid K+ loss from the plant’s cellular cytosol, whereas PGPR 
retains more K+ in order to maintain a higher K+-Na+ ratio and avoid osmotic imbalance17. Furthermore, PGPR 
helps to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NaCl in plant cells by raising the amounts of ROS-
scavenging enzymes18.
In high-salinity conditions, various PGPR can regulate and stimulate plant growth. According to various 
investigations, such bacteria belong to the following families: Azospirillum , Alcaligenes , Arthrobacter , 
Acinetobacter , Bacillus , Burkholderia , Bradyrhizobium , Enterobacter , Erwinia , Flavobacterium , Pseudomonas , 
Rhizobium , and Serratia19. Tryptophan is a key precursor that contributes significantly to bacteria’s biosynthetic 
pathway for the creation of IAA. During tryptophan metabolism, carbohydrates and sugar molecules are 
moved around. It will control physiological processes including cell proliferation, tissue differentiation, and 
tactic responses20. IAA is produced by both bacteria and plants through Trp-dependent and Trp-independent 
mechanisms21. However, the majority of earlier investigations on IAA production focused on Trp-dependent 
pathways, with few studies examining Trp-independent processes. The intermediary stages and genes involved 
in Trp-independent pathways remain unknown. Bacteria’s key IAA biosynthesis routes have been identified as 
IPA, IAM, and indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN)22. A higher percentage of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria have been 
isolated from several environmental sources, including rhizosphere soil, metal-contaminated soil, phosphate 
mines, composts, and macro fauna23. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria have been used as a novel biotechnology 
method. It has the ability to solubilize rock phosphate and serve as a fertilizer24. The bacteria produce organic 
acid, which chelates the cations. Phosphate is bound through hydroxyl and carboxyl groups before being 
released as soluble phosphate25. Bacterial solubilization lowers the pH of the media through either H+ extrusion 
or the secretion of organic acids such as gluconic, citric, oxalic, succinic, lactic, formic, and acetic acids. These 
microorganisms have increased the solubility of rock phosphate26. Our research findings include rhizosphere 
soil bacteria isolation from the agricultural soil of beetroot and carrot vegetable cultivation areas in Nilgiri 
district, Tamil Nadu, India. The ability of the isolated bacterial species to tolerate salt stress was studied. In the 
synthesis of IAA, the phosphate solubilizing capability, ammonium, HCN, and siderophore must be examined.
Materials and methods
Isolation of rhizosphere soil bacteria
The soil samples were collected from the beetroot and carrot rhizosphere soil in the Nilgiri district of Kilkothagiri, 
Tamil Nadu, India, at latitude 11.384° N and longitude 76.74305° E. The pH of the sampled soil was 7. The bacteria 
were isolated using the following procedure: 1 g of soil sample was obtained and mixed with approximately 
10 mL of sterile distilled water (1:10 ratio). This diluted sample was taken up to 1 mL and serially diluted (10–1 to 
10–7). The pour plate method was used to pour approximately 1 mL of each diluted sample onto the nutrient agar 
medium (Himedia, India). Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. A single colony developed in dilution and was 
selected for a streak on sterilized nutrient agar medium. Four bacterial colonies were successfully isolated and 
preserved. They were tested for salt stress tolerance and plant growth-promoting properties.
Morphological characteristics of Bacterial isolates
After the cultures were screened out on the basis of colony morphology, distinct microbial colonies were counted 
and subsequently pure-cultured. The colony color, shape, and margin were noted. After that, the pure colonies 
were maintained solidified agar plates at 4 °C and used for further characterization studies. Next, the biochemical 
characterization was analyzed.
Biochemical characteristics of Bacterial isolates
Indole test
Take a sterile test tube and add 4 mL of tryptophan broth. Inoculate the tube aseptically by removing the growth 
from an 18- to 24-h culture. Incubate the tube at 37 °C for 24–28 h. Add 0.5 mL of Kovac’s reagent to the broth 
culture. Check for the presence or absence of a ring27.

The medium includes proteose peptone (10.00 g). HM Peptone B (beef extract): 1 g; sodium chloride: 5.00 g. 
Mix 0.018 g of Phenol Red and 10 g of glucose in 1 L of clean water. Use a sterile inoculating loop to collect a 
well-isolated colony from a fresh culture of sample bacteria (18 to 24 h old) and add it to the broth. Incubate 
tubes at 35 ± 2 °C for 18–24 h. Check for color changes in the soup and trapped air bubbles in Durham’s tube. If 
no color change or air bubbles appear, incubate the tubes for an additional 24 h before checking for color change 
and air bubbles28.
Methyl red test
Allow the medium to reach room temperature before inoculating. Use organisms from an 18–24-hour pure 
culture to slightly inoculate the medium. Incubate aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h. After 24 h of incubation, transfer 
1 ml of broth to a clean test tube. Add 2–3 drops of methyl red indicator to the aliquot. Check for red quickly29.
Voges-Proskauer test
Allow the medium to reach room temperature before inoculating. Use organisms from an 18–24-hour pure 
culture to mildly inoculate the medium. Incubate aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h. After 24 h of incubation, transfer 
2 mL of broth to a clean test tube. Re-incubate the remaining broth for another 24 h. Add 6 drops of 5% alpha-
naphthol and mix thoroughly to aerate. Add 2 drops of 40% potassium hydroxide and mix thoroughly to aerate. 
Within 30 min, observe for a pinkish-red tint on the surface. Shake the tube aggressively for the entire 30-min 
time30.
Citrate utilization test
Streak the slant back and forth with a mild inoculum obtained from the center of a well-isolated colony. The 
colony was inoculated onto simmons citrate agar. Incubate aerobically at 35 to 37 °C for 4–7 days. Observe the 
color change from green to blue31.
Catalase test
Using a loop or sterilized wooden stick, transfer a little bit of colony development to the surface of a clean, dry 
glass slide. Add a drop of 3% H2O2 to the glass slide. Observe the evolution of oxygen bubbles32.
Ammonia production test
Freshly developed cultures were injected into 10 mL of peptone water in each tube and incubated for 48–72 h at 
28 ± 2 °C. Nessler’s reagent (0.5 mL) was added to each tube. The development of a brown-to-yellow tint was a 
positive indicator of ammonia production33.
Potassium hydroxide solubilization test
Apply one drop of 3% KOH to a microscope slide. Use the loop to transfer a generous number of bacteria 
(cultivated for 24–48 h) to a drop of KOH. Stir carefully. Gram-negative bacteria solutions are viscous and form 
a mucoid string within 30 s, whereas gram-positive bacteria solutions are not viscous.
Characterization of bacterial isolates
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Bacterial genomic DNA was recovered via overnight culture using the CTAB (Cetyl trimethyl ammonium 
bromide) technique34. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using a forward primer (5'  G A G T T T G A T C G T G G 
C T C A G 3’) and a reverse primer (5'  A G G G C T  A C C T T G T T A G A C T T 3’). PCR analysis using a reaction mixer 
volume of 20 µl. Emerald Amp GT PCR master mix contains MQ water, 10X Taq buffer, 15 mM MgCl2, Taq 
polymerase, 4 mM DNTPs, genomic DNA, reverse and forward primers, and sterile water. PCR amplification 
was carried out in the following manner: initial denaturation at 96 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles. They 
performed three steps: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 48 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 2 min, 
and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplified PCR products were sequenced on a 3500 genetic analyzer 
(Thermo Fisher, India). The ExoSAP-ITTM PCR product cleanup reagent was used to remove unincorporated 
PCR primers and dNTPs from the amplified PCR product. The thermocyclic reaction is then followed by ethanol 
precipitation of the PCR products. The DNA sample was then tested using a genetic analyzer. The 16S rRNA gene 
sequences were aligned using DNA laser gene software and compared to sequences available from GenBank 
using the BLASTN program ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST ). The phylogenetic tree constructed based on 16S 
rRNA sequences from the bacterial isolates using evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining 
method35. The optimal tree is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered 
together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches36 (next to the branches). The 
evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method37 and are in units 
of the number of base substitutions per site. This analysis involved 35 nucleotide sequences. All ambiguous 
positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 1573 positions 
in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA1138.
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database
The 16S rRNA sequences of the four bacterial species were examined at NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology 
Information) and deposited under the accession numbers BR1 ON819727.1, BR2 ON819728.1, CR1 OR478038.1, 
and CR2 OR478039.1.

The incubation period for bacterial strains was tested for indole-acetic acid synthesis. When IAA production 
levels increased over time, the impacts of the incubation period were determined. The bacterial species were 
cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks with 100 mL of nutrient broth. Inoculated with 0.1 mL of culture and supplemented 
with 0.1% L-tryptophan. The culture was incubated for periods ranging from 1 to 10 days at 37 °C. Following 
incubation, the culture supernatant was centrifuged and tested for IAA synthesis using the colorimetric 
technique. The supernatant was combined with a 1:2 salkowski reagent (0.5 M FeCl3 and 70% perchloric acid). 
Have incubated in the dark for 30 min and measured the absorbance of OD at 530 nm39.
Determination of salt stress tolerance Bacteria for Indole-3-acetic acid production
The four bacterial strains have been examined for salt tolerance efficiency at various concentration levels. Each 
isolate was inoculated with 10 mL of nutritional broth containing 0, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% NaCl and 0.1 L 
tryptophan. The tubes were cultured for one week on an orbital shaker at 250 rpm and 37 °C. After that, the 
culture was centrifuged at 6000  rpm for 15  min. The turbidity of the assigned bacterial cells was evaluated 
using a spectrophotometer (Labtronics, India) at 600 nm. IAA production was measured using a calorimetric 
technique with a 1:2 salkowski reagent (0.5 M FeCl3 and 70% perchloric acid). The concentration was calculated 
using a standard curve of IAA absorbance at 530 nm39. They were successful in determining the bacteria with 
the bacteria with the highest salt tolerance and their IAA acid production.
Quantification of Bacterial phosphate solubilization
The phosphate solubility of bacteria was quantified using Pikovskaya’s broth and tricalcium phosphate as a 
substrate40. The PVK broth (10 mL) containing 0, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% NaCl was added to the culture tube 
and then screened for bacteria. Each sample was inoculated with 100 µl in triplicate. The culture was cultured 
for 7 days at 37 °C on an orbital shaker at 250 rpm. After incubation, the culture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 
15 min, and the supernatant was collected. 0.5 mL of culture supernatant was combined with 10% trichloroacetic 
acid in an equal proportion. Add 3 mL of the reagent combination to the culture supernatant (1:1:1:2 ratios 
of 3 M H2SO4, 2.5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, 10% (w/v) ascorbic acid, and distilled water). The culture 
was then allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 min. The color-changing blue was used to assess the 
amount of soluble phosphorus in the sample. The absorbance at 820 nm was measured against the KH2PO4 
standard curve (Himedia, India).
Ammonia (NH3) production test
Ammonium production was analyzed. The bacterial isolates were inoculated in peptone water containing 10.0 g 
peptone, 5.0 g Nacl, 1,000 ml distilled water, and 7.0 pH, with NaCl stress concentrations of 0, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 
and 5%, respectively. Incubate 100 μl of culture in 10 mL of peptone water at 28 ± 2 °C for 48–72 h on an orbital 
shaker at 350 rpm. Following incubation, the culture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. To extract the 
supernatant, add 0.5  mL of Nessler’s reagent. The change from brown to yellow was measured using OD at 
450 nm. Ammonium sulfate was employed as a standard41.
Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production
HCN production was estimated. The bacterial isolates were inoculated in nutritional broth at concentrations of 
0, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% NaCl stress and supplemented with glycine (4.4 g/L). The culture was then inoculated, 
and a uniform-sized piece of filter paper was soaked in 2% sodium carbonate in a 0.5% picric acid solution 
before being suspended within the conical flasks. The reddish chemical originated in filter paper. The color 
was eluted by placing the filter paper in a test tube containing 10 mL of distilled water, and the absorbance was 
measured at 625 nm. Sodium cyanide was employed as the standard42.
Estimation of siderophore production
Siderophore production was quantified. The bacterial isolates were inoculated into nutritional broth with 
different concentrations of NaCl stress (0, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5%). Fill 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks with 100 ml 
of broth and sterilize thoroughly. After adding 1 mL of inoculum to the culture broth, it was incubated at 37 
ºC for 7 days in an orbital shaker at 300 rpm. Afterward, the bacterial inoculum was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm 
for 20  min. The culture supernatant was collected, and the pH was adjusted to 2.0 using diluted HCL. The 
supernatant was removed twice, and an equal volume of ethyl acetate (V/V) was added to the extract. To estimate 
the siderophore, one milliliter of 0.1 M ferric chloride and 1 ml of 0.1 N HCl were mixed with 100 ml of distilled 
water, followed by 1 ml of 0.1 M potassium ferricyanide. Add 5 mL of extract assay solution to 5 mL of Hathway 
reagent and measure OD at 560 nm. The standard for salicylate-type siderophores was sodium salicylate43.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was carried out using Microsoft Office Excel (2007). Mean values for each treatment were 
determined, and the treatment means were compared using analysis of variance. The data in this study were 
statistically evaluated using one-way ANOV A and SPSS version 16. Mean values were expressed as mean ± SD. 
Values were compared using Duncan’s multiple range test with a significance level of p < 0.05.
Results and discussion
Isolation and molecular characterization of Bacterial Isolates
The PGPR has positive properties that allow it to reduce the harmful effects of excessive salt concentrations. 
PGPR can increase plant development in a salt environment in two ways: (i) activating or regulating plant 
response systems during salt exposure, and (ii) manufacturing anti-stress molecules44. To improve the growth 
Scientific Reports  |        (2024) 14:24909 4 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-75022-ywww.nature.com/scientificreports/and resistance of plants exposed to salinity, the processes include (i) improving nutrient uptake (e.g., N2 fixation, 
release of bound P and K+ from the soil, chelating iron) and maintaining the water balance; (ii) an influence 
on ion homeostasis; (iii) inducing the selective absorption of K+ and exclusion of Na+ to maintain a high K+/
Na+ ratio; (iv) the formation of bio-film to reduce Na+ toxicity; (v) changes in root architecture; (vi) modulating 
the antioxidant system; (vii) modulating osmotic substances; (viii) modulating plant hormonal levels; and (ix) 
modulating the expression of salt-responsive genes45. Recently, it has been demonstrated that PGPR inoculation 
causes DNA methylation modification, which regulates the expression of genes useful for plant growth 
promotion, and that these DNA methylation changes in the DNA of root tissues can persist even after the PGPR 
is removed from the root microbiome46.
In this investigation, salt resistance and plant growth-promoting ability were studied. The bacterial species were 
screened using nutritional broth and various amounts of (0–5% NaCl stress) (Fig.  1). Furthermore, we observed 
only four bacterial species with great salt stress tolerance and higher potential plant development capabilities. In 
this investigation, these bacterial species only further classified morphologically and biochemically (Tables 1 and 
2). Following this, the bacterial strains were genetically identified. The bacterial genomic DNA was extracted, and 
its purity was determined using Agarose gel electrophoresis and a comparison to the 1500 kbp ladder (Fig.  2). 
Following that, the DNA was amplified using a polymerase chain reaction. Then they were genetically identified 
using 16S rRNA sequencing. According to their sequence identification, BR1 is the Solibacillus silvestris ; BR2 
is Peribacillus frigoritolerans; Paenibacillus taichungensis  CR1; and Solibacillus isronensis  CR2. The bacterial 
isolates’ sequences were placed in the gene bank of the nucleotide sequence database at the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under strains BR1 ON819727.1, BR2 ON819728.1, CR1 OR478038.1, and 
CR2 OR478039.1.
Bacillus silvestris  has been identified as a new Bacillus  species47. After that, it was classified as Solibacillus 
silvestris48. Only a few studies on this bacterial characterization were available. The whole genome and 
characterization of AHL-degrading S. silvestris  were isolated from potato leaf surfaces. They are related to our 
sequence studies49. The study reclassified Brevibacterium frigoritolerans  based on phylogenetic and molecular 
synapomorphies. The examination of DNA-DNA hybridization, nucleotide identity, and the difference in 
G + C content all support the phylogenetic inference that Brevibacterium frigoritolerans  and the environmental 
isolate EB93 are the same. Based on data from numerous lines of study, it was reclassified as Peribacillus 
frigoritolerans50. According to our findings, Peribacillus frigoritolerans  BR2 was isolated from beetroot rhizosphere 
soil. The type strain is V10537T new species in the Paenibacillus  genus, named Paenibacillus taichungensis  sp. 
nov. due to its distinct characteristics from previous species.
Paenibacillus taichungensis , discovered in Taiwanese soil, is a distinct gram-variable, rod-shaped, motile, 
endospore-forming bacterial strain. Strain V10537T is proposed as a new species of the genus Paenibacillus  nov., 
Paenibacillus taichungensis  sp. based on phylogenetic, phenotypic, genotypic, and chemotaxonomic evidence. 
Phenotypic characteristics that are closely connected to novel Paenibacillus  species51. Similarly, the Paenibacillus 
taichungensis  CR1 strain was identified from carrot rhizosphere soil in the Nilgiri area of Tamil Nadu, India. 
Solibacillus isronensis  and Solibacillus silvestris  share a phylogenetic lineage that overlaps the phenotypic features 
of the Solibacillus  genus49 (Fig.  3).
Effect of various incubation periods on IAA producing Bacterial Isolates
The incubation period was the most beneficial characteristic for producing Indole acetic acid. The bacterial 
isolates were cultured in a nutritional medium containing L-tryptophan. The bacterial strains were incubated for 
various incubation periods, such as 1, 3, 7, and 10 days, to produce indole acetic acid. Our findings demonstrated 
that Solibacillus silvestris  BR1, Peribacillus frigoritolerans  BR2, Paenibacillus taichungensis  CR1, and Solibacillus 
isronensis  CR2 have the potential to produce the higher amount of IAA after 7 and 10  days of incubation 
(Fig.  4a). Solibacillus isronensis  CR2 produced the highest amount of Indole acetic acid (646.111 ± 8.058a µg/
mL) after 10 days of incubation, while the BR1 strain produced (268.33 ± 0.33b µg/mL) after 7 days. At one 
day of incubation, the BR2 strain produced less IAA (19.66 ± 1.528n µg/mL). After one day of incubation, the 
BR1 produced (35.66 ± 1.764 m µg/mL) (Table 3). The bacteria Bacillus subtilis , like our findings, produced a 
significant amount of production during the 96-h incubation period52. IAA synthesis in S. silvestris  decreased 
with longer incubation periods (46.556 ± 4.718ll µg/mL). P . frigoritolerans  (115.66 ± 0.577j µg/mL) levels were 
reduced after 10 days of incubation. During the 3-day incubation period, IAA production increased progressively 
in CR2 (188.333 ± 2.186e µg/mL), followed by CR1 (181.222 ± 1.644f. µg/mL), BR1 (68.22 ± 1.530k µg/mL), and 
BR2 (46.11 ± 3.15l µg/mL) (Fig.  4a). IAA synthesis levels differ among microbes54. Bacterial species, strains, 
culture conditions, substrate availability, and growth stage may all have an impact on indole acetic acid synthesis.
Screening of salt tolerant Bacteria  for the production of IAA
The rhizo-microbiome produces phytohormones in low concentrations, which act as chemical messengers to 
regulate the metabolic pathways of growth simulators in plants and alter root shape when stressed. Several 
published study findings support the concept that phytohormones synthesis is one of the primary plant stress 
relief methods used by microorganisms. Auxin and IAA stimulate cellular division, growth, and differentiation 
in plant roots, as well as the formation of lateral roots, both of which help plants to absorb nutrients and retain 
water54,55. Salt stress has influenced plants’ physiological and biochemical systems and pathways, causing 
sufficient food absorption, altering growth-inducing regulators, and inhibiting protein synthesis56. Bacterial 
isolates were grown in a nutritional broth medium containing L-tryptophan at varying concentrations (0, 1%, 
2%, 3%, 4%, and 5% NaCl). The culture was then incubated for 7  days at ambient temperature. The ability 
to produce IAA was then determined using the IAA standard curve. S. isronensis  CR2 produced the largest

NaCl stress, Peribacillus frigoritolerans  BR2 produced (29.556 ± 1.171n µg/mL), while Solibacillus silvestris  BR1 
produced (38.111 ± 2.411 m µg/mL), the least amount of IAA shown in Table 4. Paenibacillus taichungensis  CR1

(Fig.  4b). Similar to our studies, Hallobacillus  strains produced the highest quantity of IAA compared to SK-Pbt

cause senescence, chlorosis, and abscission processes, and result in plant death58. Halo-tolerant microorganisms 
have a high potential for agricultural crop productivity in arid and semi-arid settings59.
Determination of Phosphate solubilization of Rhizobacteria
Phosphorus stress causes the plant to be unable to absorb nutrients. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria may help 
plants cope with stress60. In our study, we examined the phosphate solubilization capability of IAA salt-stress-
tolerant bacteria on Pikovskayas agar medium using a tricalcium phosphate source. The primary mechanism 
of phosphate solubilization is the formation of organic acids. Organic acids generated by microorganisms 
include gluconic, formic, 2-ketogluconic, citric, oxalic, lactic, isovaleric, succinic, glucolic, and acetic acids58. 
Bacillus  species is the most abundant bacteria in the rhizosphere, have evolved various methods to promote 
plant growth and boost nutrient availability. Phosphate solubilization was quantified in the liquid broth of a 
Pikovskay’s medium culture with various doses of sodium chloride (0, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, and 5%) after 7 days. At 
5% NaCl stress, the Solibacillus isronensis  CR2 strain (0.921 ± 0.007a µg/mL) and Paenibacillus taichungensis  CR1 
strain (0.851 ± 0.012a, b µg/mL) exhibited the highest phosphate solubilization levels. Phosphate solubilization 
was strong at 5% NaCl stress (Table 5). Because the bacterial isolates are exposed to hyper-osmotic-adaptation 
pathways, they synthesize suitable solutes or accumulate potassium in order to overcome Na+ ion toxicity. 
Many non-halophilic bacteria have also been shown to accumulate potassium in response to sodium stress61. 
High NaCl concentrations often disrupt membrane transport systems and denature proteins; however, some 
microbes have atypical plasma membranes and many peculiar enzymes that allow them to live for prolonged 
periods of time under such harsh stress circumstances. It has been discovered that osmo-tolerance responses, 
de novo synthesis of osmolytes, and excess production of salt stress proteins effectively eliminate the negative 
effects of excessive osmolarity62. At 1% NaCl stress, Solibacillus silvestris  BR1 and Peribacillus frigoritolerans  BR2 
had higher average phosphate solubilization (0.789 ± 0.039b,c µg/mL and 0.588 ± 0.035f. µg/mL, respectively) 
(Fig.  4c). Similarly to our findings, the three different Bacillus  bacteria have rock phosphate solubilization. 
Bacillus cereus  S0B4 has been shown to have a high solubilization capacity of 338.5 mg/L. Following other species, 
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  (287.6  mg/L) and Solibacillus isronensis  S0B8 (271.7  mg/L) have been reported to 
have the highest amount42. The CR2 strain had the highest phosphate solubilization, while the BR2 strain had 
a smaller quantity (0.145 ± 0.011° µg/mL) at 5% NaCl stress (Table 5). Phosphorus plays a crucial role in plant 
photosynthesis, respiration, energy storage and transfer, cell division and growth. Soil microorganisms have the 
ability to transform inorganic phosphate into an insoluble form due to their solubility capacity. This bacterium 
is highly beneficial for plant nutrient uptake from phosphorus63,64. It can serve as a future option for organic bio 
fertilizers.
Ammonium production determination of Rhizobacteria
Ammonium is a significant nutrient for plants and aids in atmospheric nitrogen fixation. Salt stress is a serious 
issue for ammonium formation in soil. It affects nitrification and ammonification in soil because chloride (Cl-) 
competes with nitrate (NO3-), causing ion toxicities and ionic inequalities that can specifically limit N uptake, S. No Biochemical testsSolibacillus silvestris

NaCl stress levels using the approach of19. Ammonium sulfate was used as a standard curve. At 1% NaCl stress, 
the Solibacillus isronensis  CR2 strain produced the more production of ammonium (1.202 ± 0.142a µg/mL), 
while the Paenibacillus taichungensis  CR1 strain produced (1.09 ± 0.071b µg/mL) (Fig.  4d). Solibacillus silvestris  
BR1 (0.849 ± 0.003f, g µg/mL) and Peribacillus frigoritolerans  BR2 (0.814 ± 0.032f, g µg/mL) were later detected. 
When compared with other strains, BR2 produced the least quantity of ammonium. The BR2 strain had the 
lowest amount (0.299 ± 0.047 h µg/mL) under 5% NaCl stress (Table 6). Ammonium nitrogen fixation occurred 
with the help of the nitrogenase enzyme, which reduced H+ to H2. Because the liberated hydrogen gas is lost to 
the atmosphere, the ATP used to produce is wasted. If any of the strains include the enzyme hydrogenase, they 
can recover H2 from the atmosphere and convert it back into H+ for the synthesis of ATP , which can then be used 
for more nitrogen fixation. These strains preserve energy while also fixing nitrogen67.

Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is one of the secondary metabolites and a volatile molecule. Many rhizobacteria 
produce them, and they have a potent effect on a wide range of species. Many bacterial genera can produce HCN, 
including species of Alcaligenes , Aeromonas , Bacillus , Pseudomonas , and Rhizobium68. In the present study, BR1,

(Table 7). As salt stress increased, HCN production eventually decreased. In plants, HCN indirectly improved

Determination of Siderophore production of Rhizobacteria
Rhizosphere soil microorganisms have the potential to create siderophores. They are bacterial molecules that are 
organic in nature and weigh 500 to 1500 Da. They are specialized metal-chelating Fe3+ compounds generated 
by microorganisms under constrained conditions to boost their iron absorption ability70,71. In this work, we 
determined the catecholate type of siderophore manufacturing ability using sodium salicylate as the reference. 
The Solibacillus isronensis  CR2 strain (1.543 ± 0.108a µg/mL) and Paenibacillus taichungensis  CR1 (0.936 ± 0.036b 
µg/mL) produced the most siderophores at 1% NaCl concentration (Table 8). The Peribacillus frigoritolerans  BR2 
stain revealed the lowest amount (0.190 ± 0.064l µg/mL) when NaCl stress was increased by 5%. Our research 
found that increasing the salt concentration level resulted in the lowest amount of siderophore formation. The 
BR2 strain produced the least quantity, followed by CR1, BR1, and CR2 at 5% NaCl stress (Fig.  4f). Siderophores 
are classified into three groups: hydroxamate, catecholate, and carboxylate72. However, some siderophores include 
ligands that contain a combination of lysine, ornithine, and histamine derivatives73. Siderophore synthesis may 
be regulated by environmental factors such as pH, metal pollution, and microbe-Fe3+ interactions74. Plant growth 
and development involve colonizing the plant roots, eliminating iron from the surface area, and producing an 
environment conducive to root development75. Our studies showed that rhizobacteria have the ability to create 
plant growth-promoting compounds. In the future, beneficial microorganisms from rhizosphere soil will be 
extracted and turned into bio fertilizers. It will promote plant growth and development as non-hazardous and 
environmentally friendly manner.
Conclusion
Salinity stress is a major issue with agricultural crops. These issues are primarily attributable to environmental 
causes and ecological changes. Eco-friendly and non-hazardous alternative technology is required to overcome 
salt stress. From these additional viewpoints, plant growth-promoting microorganisms can be used to implement 
novel tactics. Rhizosphere soil microorganisms serve a range of functions in plants. It transfers nutrients from 
the earth to the plant. This microorganism is useful for regulating soil pollution, fertility, erosion, heavy metal 
contamination, and organic and inorganic contaminants. So, it can be utilized to participate in the plant 
growth and development process in a non-hazardous way. Our research indicated that the isolated salt-stress-
tolerant bacteria have the ability to produce plant growth compounds. The four salt-tolerant bacterial species 
were screened out. In this study, the bacterial strains Solibacillus silvestris  BR1, Peribacillus frigoritolerans  BR2, 
Paenibacillus taichungensis  CR1, and Solibacillus isronensis  CR2 were identified. In comparison, S. isronensis  
CR2 has a higher capacity for salt tolerance and produces a large number of plant growth-promoting chemicals 
such as IAA, phosphate solubilization, ammonium synthesis, HCN, and siderophores. Our research found that 
Solibacillus isronensis  CR2 and Paenibacillus taichungensis  CR1 are more effective and capable of producing high-S. No NaCl (Con. %)Siderophore production Con. µg/mL
